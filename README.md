**PROJECT TITLE:**
WATER TURBIDITY SENSOR FOR DFL7000s CHILLER UNIT.

**DESCRIPTION:**
This Water Turbidity Prototype is made for an improvement presentation in DISCO Japan.
It is an Arduino-based device that measures and displays turbidity of water inside the laser machine chiller unit in order to determine if the water needs to be replaced so that the chiller unit and its piping path will not clog due to the impurities and accumulated dirt on the tank.

**RESULTS:**
A report is generated for the presentation of the prototype and was shown that the prototype detects and alarms when water is dirty.
This triggers the maintenance team to perform water replacement on the tank.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
1. Arduino Uno (Coded using Arduino IDE)
2. LCD display (using LiquidCrystal_I2C library)
3. Turbidity Sensor (Analog)
